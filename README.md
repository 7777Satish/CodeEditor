# CodeDesk

CodeDesk is a browser-based code editor built using React. Initially powered by Monaco Editor, this project is evolving to include a custom-built editor for enhanced flexibility and a deeper understanding of how editors work.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for various programming languages (powered by Monaco).
- Auto-complete functionality.
- Customizable themes and fonts.
- Code linting and error highlighting (to be enhanced in future updates).

## Why I Built This Project
I created CodeDesk to simplify the process of writing and managing code directly in the browser while learning the inner workings of code editors. This project reflects my passion for building developer tools and exploring innovative solutions that enhance productivity.

## Live Demo
